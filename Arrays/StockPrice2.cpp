// You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
// On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However,
// you can sell and buy the stock multiple times on the same day, ensuring you never hold more than one share of the stock.
// Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.
